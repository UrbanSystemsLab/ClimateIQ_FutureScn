# ClimateIQ Future Scenarios

## Contributors
Ashish Shrestha, Peng Zhao, Evan Christo

## Purpose
This repo is for downloading and processing future rainfall scenarios (CMIP6, LOCA), calculating predicted rainfall recurrence intervals, and comparing them to observed rainfall recurrence intervals (NOAA Atlas 14). Scripts include:
- Downloading LOCA data for a single coordinate point
- Downloading CMIP6 data for a single coordinate point
- Downloading NOAA Atlas 14 data for a single coordinate point
- Calculating the GEV values for a given time series of rainfall
- Calculating rainfall recurrence intervals for given GEV values
- Comparing the LOCA/CMIP6 and NOAA Atlas 14 recurrence intervals
